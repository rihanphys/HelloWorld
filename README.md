# HelloWorld
for learning how to use Git
Now I am reading the user guide for GitHub. It told me to edit this readme file. So that I can understand the commit and pull etc. I have to commit this changes and write a proper commit message for the same. I hope I am learning well. I would edit this later if I need more practice on commit. 2017-01-24.
